this is just an initial playground.

Ideas:

* have a default json, using the "correct" names for the XML structure, merge it with an "instance" (eg. m87), and
generate XML from there
* let the json contain a template pointer for more fine-tuned things
* have a smarter templating system, eg. for services
* potentially allow for some randomicity (eg. for MAC address, UDN/UUID, etc..


...

now the folder is just a mix of things. at the end, if there's a template and/or a default yaml(json), it shouldn't
be in an "example" folder.
